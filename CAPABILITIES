Requires :
 Fuse filesystem libraries.
 Install Fuse from here: http://fuse.sourceforge.net/
 
 Python

Uses: http://code.google.com/p/fusepy/ - Provided with this software.


DropFuse limitations and capabilites:

1).
 Uses an SGML html parser to extract the document information.
 This is hardly optimal, but I am not aware of any official API for the
 linked folder feature introduced by Dropbox in client 0.8
 
2).
 It will mount the linked folder to a specified directory, but it will
 not refresh the mounted directory if the remote shared folder has been
 updated on Dropbox servers.
 
3).
 Once mounted, folder's contents can be easily copied to your local storage.
 No data is transferred until a copy is performed.
 Copy them to a local folder before using.
 Currently, copying process seems to rather slow.
 
4).
 Reading nested subfolders is not supported yet.
 Only files located directly in linked folder are usable.
 
5).
 Do not use the URL shortener service link provided by Dropbox
 These links look like this: http://db.tt/bP1ntM and are not supported yet.
 Use the actual destination link which is usually shown in the browser's
 address bar.

See README for instructions.
